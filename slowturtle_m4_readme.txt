iv. There should be no specific install instruction for the grader.

v. 
Game Controls:
W,A,S,D: Locomotion
Right Mouse Button: Adjust Camera
E: Drag and Push
Space: Switch between Human/Specter
R: Turn on and off Lights & pick up/drop bomb. (The bomb can only be dropped in spector mode)

  Main Menu: The grader should open the Main Menu scene located in Assets/Scenes/Menus. The graphics in the Main Menu were custom made to fit with our game feel. The background of the main menu is animated with a flickering light, zombie shadow, sparks and there is an anmimation that takes the camera so the next room to show the credits. There is also ambient music to add to the game feel of the Main Menu. The menu can be navigated by using the mouse to point and click or by using W and S keys to move up and down between menu items (The selected menu item is a darker shade) then pressing Enter/Return will select. Selecting "Play" will take the user to the Scene where they can see our particle effects in action. The "Log" menu item is currently unimplemented. Selecting "Credits" will display the credits. The credits are show using a verticle scroller. 
  Particle Effects: We have two particle effects, each consisting of two particle systems(satisfying requirement 7). The first is the explosion effect(Assets/Prefabs/Explosion) that can be seen when the user presses the B key and the bomb blows up(requirement 12). The explosion has two systems, the fireball and the smoke that is sub emitted after the fireball(satisfying requirement 11). The fireball and smoke both change in size over the lifetime of the effect(requirement 8). The texture for the fireball in the explosion was custom(requirement 10) and taken from http://graphicriver.net/item/fireball/2945923. The second effect is the ElectroPanel. This is located in the scene at south east corner of the level. This effect has a change in velocity over the lifetime of the particle(requirement 9). This also uses a sub-emitter to create a smoke effect after the spark paricle fades.

vi. The main scene that the grader should open is in Assets/Scenes/Menus/Mainmenu.
